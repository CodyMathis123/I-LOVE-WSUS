# Simplify WSUS SSL Configuration

The goal of this PowerShell module is to simplify the process of converting a WSUS server to support SSL.

As noted by Microsoft in the [Security best practices for Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/security-best-practices-for-windows-server-update-services-wsus/ba-p/1587536) article there are IIS changes needed. This module makes those IIS changes quick, simple, and reportable.

To build on this article, shortly after it was written they released an additional article regarding [Changes to improve security for Windows devices scanning WSUS
](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/changes-to-improve-security-for-windows-devices-scanning-wsus/ba-p/1645547).
